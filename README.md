# Network Application with Cryptographic Primitive

## Task Description

Develop a network application that fulfills the following requirements:

1. **Network Communication**: Implement two processes that communicate through the network stack.

2. **Cryptographic Primitive**: Integrate a single cryptographic primitive (e.g., signature verification, cryptographic accumulator) that serves a practical purpose within the application. Use any publicly available crate; re-implementation is not necessary.

3. **Documentation**: Provide a brief explanation of how the cryptographic primitive is used in convolution, including one or two examples. Discuss performance and security considerations for production applications.

---

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- **Coding Practices**: Clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
- **Functionality**: The application works correctly and demonstrates proper use of the cryptographic primitive.
- **Discussion Preparedness**: Be ready to discuss library choices, network design, overall architecture, and production challenges.
